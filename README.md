# (n)ear (e)arth (o)bject Exploration
Search for and explore close approaches of near-Earth objects (NEOs), 
using data from NASA/JPL's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.

## Overview
At a high-level, you'll create Python code that implements a command-line tool to inspect and 
query a dataset of NEOs and their close approaches to Earth.

Concretely, you'll have to read data from both a CSV file and a JSON file, convert that 
data into structured Python objects, perform filtering operations on the data, limit the size 
of the result set, and write the results to a file in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON.

When complete, you'll be able to inspect the properties of the near-Earth objects in the 
data set and query the data set of close approaches to Earth using any combination of the 
following filters:

- Occurs on a given date.
- Occurs on or after a given start date.
- Occurs on or before a given end date.
- Approaches Earth at a distance of at least (or at most) X astronomical units.
- Approaches Earth at a relative velocity of at least (or at most) Y kilometers per second.
- Has a diameter that is at least as large as (or at least as small as) Z kilometers.
- Is marked by NASA as potentially hazardous (or not).
